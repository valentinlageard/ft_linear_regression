# Linear Regression

A project for 42 where we must predict the price of a car based on its mileage using linear regression.

While the subject is a simple linear regression (1 regressor and 1 regressand), I implemented a multiple linear regression model (n regressors and 1 regressand) in matrix form (with numpy).

## Usage
- `python3 -m venv .venv`
- `source .venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python3 train.py`
- `python3 predict.py`
- `python3 precision.py`
