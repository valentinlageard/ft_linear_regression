# Linear Regression

A project for 42 where we must predict the price of a car based on its mileage using linear regression.

While the subject is a simple linear regression (1 regressor and 1 regressand), I implemented a multiple linear regression model (n regressors and 1 regressand) in matrix form (with numpy).

## Usage

`python3 predict.py` to predict a price given a mileage.

`python3 train.py` to train the model on the dataset.

## TODO

- Add a parameter to visualize the regression in `train.py`
- Add the proof for the matrix form of destandardization.
- Review the notebooks.
